<p>
    I didnt build any of these but did want to provide a little fun on the app, so you can pick from a few different games that are built into this app and are all in Angular.
</p>
<p>
    The only coding take-away here is that I can use other peoples code natively in app and plus got to see a few tricks in how they built these.
</p>
<p>
    I ll make one caveat that I did add buttons to both of these games so they work on mobile.
